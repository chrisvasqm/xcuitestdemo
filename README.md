# XCUITest Demo Project

Simple app project that consists of two screens, the first one is a Login form and the second one is just an blank screen with a label.

If the user enters an invalid set of `username` and `password`, an `Alert` will be displayed, otherwise, the user will be redirected to the following screen.

This logic will be tested using the XCUITest framework from Apple in order to serve as an example of how to setup and run tests with it.
